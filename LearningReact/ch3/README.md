# Ticking Clock

Our challenge is to build a ticking clock. The clock needs to display hours, minutes,
seconds and time of day in civilian time. Each field must always have double digits,
meaning leading zeros need to be applied to single digit values like 1 or 2. The clock
must also tick and change the display every second.

Running the program:

```bash
node main.js
```
